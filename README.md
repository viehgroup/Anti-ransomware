This is a simple code in Python that can help detect and prevent ransomware behavior by comparing file hashes against known good hashes.

Requirements
The following packages are required for this code to work:

hashlib
os
sys
You can install these packages by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage
The code performs a directory tree scan, checking each file against a known good hash. If the hash of the file doesn't match the known good hash, it reports the file as possibly being encrypted by ransomware.

Note
This code is intended for educational purposes only and is not a complete solution for preventing ransomware. Implementing a proper anti-ransomware program involves many other techniques and technologies, such as monitoring file system activity for malicious behavior, using strong backups, and implementing security best practices.
